# Computer-Networks
This repository contains assignments and projects for my Computer Networks course. It includes various implementations and experiments related to network protocols, packet switching, routing, and other essential networking concepts. Each assignment folder contains code, documentation, and any necessary configuration files.

## Assignment 1 - Computer Networks

This assignment explores basic networking commands and their functionalities. It covers the following tasks:

1. **IP Address Identification**: Use the `ifconfig` command to find the IP address of your network interface and compare it with the IP shown on a web service like [WhatIsMyIP](https://www.whatismyip.com).
2. **IP Address Configuration**: Learn how to change the IP address of your network interface via the command line and revert it to the original.
3. **TCP Client/Server Connection**: Set up a TCP client/server connection using `netcat` between a VM and host machine or on localhost. Analyze the state of the TCP connection.
4. **DNS Query with nslookup**: Perform DNS lookups to obtain authoritative results and time-to-live (TTL) information for a website.
5. **Traceroute and Ping Analysis**: Use `traceroute` to trace the path to `google.in` and analyze intermediate hosts. Compare latency results from `traceroute` and `ping` commands, including a comparison with `stanford.edu`.
6. **Simulating Packet Loss**: Demonstrate how to make the `ping` command fail for `127.0.0.1` with 100% packet loss.
Each task includes relevant command usage, explanations, and screenshots to demonstrate the results.
